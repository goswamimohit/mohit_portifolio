abstract: >-
  Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system is a better model to mimic the in
  vivo environment as compared to the traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell
  culture due to their cell-cell interaction, cell–extracellular matrix (ECM)
  interaction and their spatial organization of cells and receptors in spheroid
  as compared to 2D culture. In the

  present study, we compared the efficacy of our synthetic molecules based upon pyrazoloquinazoline  
   harmacophore, in 2D as well as 3D cell culture model. There was an enormous difference in activity of M-3 compound in 3D culture as compared to 2D cell culture.
  The method thus offers the scope and opportunity for the testing of drugs before entering in a preclinical trial. This may increase the chances of drug failure at advanced  level and significantly may contribute in the drug discovery.
